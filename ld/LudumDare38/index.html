			<i>A View from Above</i> is a game created in less than <b>14</b> (wow!) hours by CodeNMore for the 38th Ludum Dare competition, with the theme of "A Small World". Because of the short time frame, and a failed idea prior to this game, the game was made into an attempted short-voice-pointless-comedy-but-not-funny game! Also, there are a few bugs in the game; they will probably not be fixed, unless it becomes unplayable on some computers. All assets & code was created from scratch, with the help of the Phaser engine.
