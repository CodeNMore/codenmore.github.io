	<u>Information:</u><br>
	Mash Race was made in (well under) 48 hours for the Mini Ludum Dare, number 54.<br>
	It is a button-mashing game, where 2 players press a button the fastest that they can to win a race!<br>
	The game was made using<br>
	- HTML / JavaScript / CSS<br>
	- <a href = "http://www.threejs.org">Three.js</a> (Open-Source 3D JavaScript Library)<br>
	- <a href = "http://www.brackets.io">Brackets</a> as a text editor / live debugger<br><br>
	The code is open-source, and can be found <a href = "https://github.com/CodeNMore/MashRace-for-MiniLD54">HERE!</a><br>But, THE CODE USED WAS RUSHED AND IS NOT NEAT AND DOES NOT USE GOOD PROGRAMMING PRACTICES! USE AT OWN RISK!
